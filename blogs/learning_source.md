# Talks

- ['SPACE Webinar Series: Signal Processing And Computational image formation'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMjHRRwcsFc) by Prof. Rebecca Willett

<!---- 
- ['Statistical paradises and paradoxes in Big Data'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YLdIDOMEZs) by Xiao-Li MENG.
Xiao-Li Meng is a professor at Department of Statistics at Harvard University. In this talk, he raised several key questions to us, especially those who are fascinated by the 'Big Data': 1) quality V.S. quantity of data, 2) absolute V.S. relative size of data, 3) probabilistic sampling V.S. random sampling.

- ['How we teach computers to understand pictures'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40riCqvRoMs) by Fei-Fei LI.
Fei Fei LI is a professor at the Computer Science Department at Stanford University. In this ted talk she discusses how to "teach" a computer to understand pictures.
"To get from age 0 to 3 was hard, the real chanllenge is to go from 3 to 13 and far beyond." "First we teach the computers to see, then they help us to see better."
